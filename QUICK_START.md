# Quick Start Guide 🚀

## Day 1: Setting Up

1. **Launch the app** - You'll see the dashboard with 0 problems today
2. **Enable notifications** - Go to Settings tab → Toggle on "Daily Motivation"
3. **Log your first problem** - Tap the big + button
   - Select platform (e.g., Codeforces)
   - Choose difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard)
   - Optionally add problem ID
   - Tap Save

## Building Your Streak

### The 3-Problem Rule
- Solve **at least 3 problems per day** to maintain your streak
- The app tracks this automatically
- Miss a day = streak resets to 0 (tough love!)

### Dashboard Colors
- 🟢 **Green gradient** = You've hit today's target! Streak secured
- 🔴 **Red/pink gradient** = Still working towards target

### Progress Bar
Watch the progress bar fill up as you log problems:
- 0/3 = Empty
- 1/3 = 33%
- 2/3 = 66% (almost there!)
- 3/3 = 100% (success! 🎉)
